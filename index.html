          To snack on exercise is to do several short periods of exercise throughout the day, as the Independent
          explains, which could include taking a brisk walk or foregoing the lift in favour of the stairs. You've
          probably heard about the benefits of interval training — but exercise snacking doesn't even require a pair of
          yoga pants or a heavy dose of deodorant.

          Stair climbing in particular was the focus of a recent study by researchers from McMaster University and the
          University of British Columbia's Okanagan Campus in Canada. The study, published in the journal Applied
          Physiology, Nutrition and Metabolism, looked into the impact of a few minutes of "vigorous" stair climbing
          three times a day on cardiovascular health — and the results were surprisingly encouraging.
